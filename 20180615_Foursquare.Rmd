I downloaded my Foursquare data, which includes check-ins from 2012 to the present day. I was curious to see what places I visited most, and also to understand what I could do in R with my data file. I was a little surprised by my check-in behavior. I eat out a lot. Oh, and SoulCycle!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(janitor)
library(here)

# Load in data
df <- read_json(here("Data/checkins.json"))
venues <- df$items %>% map_df("venue")

venues %>% 
  filter(!name %in% c("United Talent Agency", "UTA Brand Studio")) %>% # I don't check in to work every day
  count(name, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n > 25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(name, n), n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = n), size = 3, nudge_y = -15, color = "white") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90)) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x="Venue", y="Check-Ins") +
  theme_minimal()
```
